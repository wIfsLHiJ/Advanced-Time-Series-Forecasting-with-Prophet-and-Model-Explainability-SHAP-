# Time-Series Forecasting using RandomForest & SHAP

This project implements a complete machine-learning based **time-series forecasting model** using **RandomForestRegressor** along with **SHAP** for explainability.  
It avoids Prophet/NeuralProphet and works in all Python environments (Python 3.8–3.12).

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates:

- Creating a synthetic time-series dataset  
- Applying feature engineering (lag features)  
- Training a RandomForest regression model  
- Forecasting future values  
- Using SHAP to explain the model's predictions  
- Saving visual outputs such as SHAP summary and dependence plots  

The project is simple, stable, and compatible with any system.
